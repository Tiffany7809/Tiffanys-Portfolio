Technologies used:
-HTML
-CSS
-JavaScript
-FlexBox
-Bootstrap
-Media Queries


This web page is meant to show what I can do with HTML and CSS for future prospective employers.
Not only wil this be an example of my skills on its own, I will also be linking other projects that I complete to this site as they are finished.
You will also find my contact information at the bottom of the page.

This web page was a challenge for me, learning FlexBox was the most confusing part. 
I still need more practice with FlexBox, but am becoming more comfertable with it.
I really enjoyed playing with the layout, colors, and effects I learned in the class so far.
